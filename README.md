# ZX81 Composite Video with Backporch
This PCB provides composite video for the ZX81, it replaces the internal PCB from the modulator. For ZX81's with earlier type ULA's it generates a back porch signal.

Also works with the 2C210 ULA, giving a very crisp output. It is based on instructions and schematics found zx.zigg.net.
